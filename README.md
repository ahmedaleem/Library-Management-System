# Library Management System 
This project is a Library Management System implemented in C++ using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, specifically Linked Lists. It simulates a real-world system where a librarian can manage a list of books with the following functionalities:

Features:

Insert New Record:
Allows the user to add new book records with details such as:
Book ID
Book Name
Author Name
Publisher Name
The new records are appended at the end of the linked list.

Search Record:
Enables searching for books by their unique Book ID.
If the book exists, its details are displayed.

Update Record:
Users can update the details of an existing book using its Book ID.
It allows modifying any field (ID, Name, Author, Publisher).

Delete Record:
Users can delete a book from the system by its Book ID.
The system updates the linked list structure to maintain consistency after deletion.

Show Records:
Displays all the book records in the library, sorted by Book ID in ascending order.

Sort Records:
The linked list is sorted based on the Book ID using the bubble sort algorithm to display the books in an organized manner.

Data Structure:
This project utilizes Linked Lists to store the books' information. Each book is represented as a node in the linked list, containing fields for the Book ID, Name, Author, and Publisher, along with a pointer to the next book in the list.

Technology Stack:
Language: C++
Data Structure: Linked List

How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Compile and run the main.cpp file using any C++ compiler.
Interact with the menu to perform various operations on the library database.

This project demonstrates key DSA concepts and provides a practical understanding of linked list operations in a library management system context.
